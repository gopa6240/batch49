Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting.

[Ans] - Nothing happens, voting pod started again as its running as deployment, FrontEnd and BackEnd working fine.
cmd - kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-mkcvk


2. Worker Pod Deletion
[Ans] - Nothing happens, Worker pod started again, FrontEnd and BackEnd working fine.

4. your comment on WHY result app STOPPED working after db pod stop
[Ans] - Result pod query the result from db, while we deleted the DB Pod result pod was unable to connect to db, So it got crash and restared.


5. your answer to HOW YOU MADE THE RESULT POD work.
[Ans] - We did nothing, result pod stared automatically and tries to connect db pod, once it got connected it was working fine.


6. Some jargons (just names are enough- dont need sentences) that you learnt from the  Training session
[Ans] - Training session was very good, we got lots of idea related to docker and kubernetes. It will help us to work in projects.
